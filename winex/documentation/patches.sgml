      <title>Patch Format</title>

      <para>
        Your patch should include:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            a description of what was wrong and what is now better
            (and now broken :).
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            your contact information ( Name/Handle and e-mail )
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            the patch in <command>diff -u</command> format (it happens...)
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
        <command>cvs diff -u</command> works great for the common case
        where a file is edited.  However, if you add or remove a file
        <command>cvs diff</command> will not report that correctly so
        make sure you explicitly take care of this rare case.
      </para>
      <para>
        For additions: mention that you have some new files and
        include them as either separate attachments or by appending
        the <command>diff -u /dev/null /my/new/file</command> output of them
	to any <command>cvs diff -u</command> output you may have.
	Alernatively, use <command>diff -Nu olddir/ newdir/</command>
	in case of multiple new files to add.
      </para>
      <para>
        For removals, list the files.
      </para>

      <title>Quality Assurance</title>

      <para>
        (Or, "How do I get Alexandre to apply my patch quickly so I
        can build on it and it will not go stale?")
      </para>
      <para>
        Make sure your patch applies to the current CVS head
        revisions.  If a bunch of patches are commited to CVS that may
        affect whether your patch will apply cleanly then verify that
        your patch does apply!   <command>cvs update</command> is your
        friend!
      </para>
      <para>
        Save yourself some embarasment and run your patched code
        against more than just your current test example.  Experience
        will tell you how much effort to apply here.
      </para>
