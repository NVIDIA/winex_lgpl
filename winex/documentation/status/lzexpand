This file contains information about the LZ file decompression libraries.

The LZ (Lempel Ziv) decompression was used in win16 installation programs.
(Win32 installation programs now use mostly CAB or WINZIP selfextractors 
 or something similair.)
It is a simple tabledriven decompression engine, the algorithm is not
documented as far as I know. WINE does not contain a compressor for
this format.

The libraries consist of LZEXPAND.DLL (win16) and LZ32.DLL (win32), the 
implementation can be found in misc/lzexpand.c and there is a small
example program in libtest/expand.c.

The implementation is complete and there have been no reports of failures
for some time.

FIXMEs:
	- Check for correct include files
	- Check whether the return values are correct
	- Write a compressor for this format.
