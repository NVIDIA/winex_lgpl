.SH NAME
widl \- Wine Interface Definition Language (IDL) compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B widl
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIinfile\fR.idl
.br
.B widl
[\fIoptions\fR] \fB--dlldata-only\fR \fIname1\fR [\fIname2\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
When no options are used the program will generate a header file, and possibly
client and server stubs, proxy and dlldata files, a typelib, and a UUID file,
depending on the contents of the IDL file.  If any of the options \fB-c\fR,
\fB-h\fR, \fB-p\fR, \fB-s\fR, \fB-t\fR, \fB-u\fR, or \fB--local-stubs\fR are given,
.B widl
will only generate the requested files, and no others.  When run with
\fB--dlldata-only\fR, widl will only generate a dlldata file, and it will
contain a list of the names passed as arguments.  Usually the way this file
is updated is that each time
.B widl
is run, it reads any existing dlldata file, and if necessary regenerates it
with the same list of names, but with the present proxy file included.
.PP
When run without any arguments,
.B widl
will print a help message.

.PP
.B UUID file options:
.IP "\fB-u\fR"
Generate a UUID file.
.IP "\fB-U \fIfile\fR"

.IP "\fB-C \fIfile\fR"
Name of client stub file (default is \fIinfile\fR_c.c)
.IP "\fB-p\fR"
Generate proxy.
.IP "\fB-P \fIfile\fR"
Name of proxy file (default is \fIinfile\fR_p.c)
.IP "\fB--prefix-all=\fIprefix\fR"
Prefix to put on the name of both client and server stubs.
.IP "\fB--prefix-client=\fIprefix\fR"
Prefix to put on the name of client stubs.
.IP "\fB--prefix-server=\fIprefix\fR"
Prefix to put on the name of server stubs.
.IP "\fB-s\fR"

.IP "\fB-S \fIfile\fR"
Name of server stub file (default is \fIinfile\fR_s.c)
.IP "\fB--win32, --win64\fR"
Only generate 32-bit, respectively 64-bit code (the default is to
generate both 32-bit and 64-bit versions into the same destination
file).
.PP
.B Dlldata file options:
.IP "\fB--dlldata=\fIfile\fR"
Name of the dlldata file (default is dlldata.c)
.PP

Do not preprocess input.
.PP
.B Debug options:
.IP "\fB-W\fR"
Enable pedantic warnings.
.IP "\fB-d \fIn\fR"
Set debug level to the non negative integer \fIn\fR.  If
prefixed with \fB0x\fR, it will be interpreted as an hexadecimal
number.  For the meaning of values, see the \fBDebug\fR section.
.PP
.B Miscellaneous options:
.IP "\fB--local-stubs=\fIfile\fR"
Generate empty stubs for call_as/local methods in an object interface and
write them to \fIfile\fR.
.PP
