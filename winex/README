This repository includes everything required to build the LGPL components of 
NVIDIA's Cider and Forge engines, including full source code for LGPL portions
as well as additional libraries required to allow those components to be built.  
The repository does not contain the remaining source code for the product, and 
also does not include a loader component to allow EXE files to be launched.

To build on Linux, simply run the following shell commands:

$ autoconf
$ ./configure
$ make
