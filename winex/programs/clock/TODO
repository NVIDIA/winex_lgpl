Some ideas for improvements:
============================

- Make "Without Titlebar", Double-clicking the clock should reveal the caption
  again.

- Font Handling of Digital Clock.
  (Does not work probably due to Winelib)

- Implement Timer Mechanism instead Polling.
  Clock does not run if menu is being selected (?).

- Fix English translation by comparing strings from an original English
  Windows Clock application (I only have a German version).

- Add new .rc resources for all languages you know. That's in fact very easy. 
  Just clone the file En.rc, change the strings and submit it. You can find
  my email address in the README file.

Please don't forget a ChangeLog entry.
