 Clock for Wine
 ==============
 
 This is a first attempt to realize a desktop clock for Wine as done in 
 Windows. It'a an early release and most of the code is still broken.

 Please see file TODO for things to do and keep the file ChangeLog
 up to date.

 Code is currently under heavy construction. Please direct patches and
 additions to my personal email address <mbaur@g26.ethz.ch>

 If you think that the compiled binary is too big, you can reduce its size
 with the command 'strip clock' (please don't try this on libraries).
