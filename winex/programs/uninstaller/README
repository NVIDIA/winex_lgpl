Uninstaller README

Uninstaller, copyright 2000, Andreas Mohr
Uninstaller is to be distributed under the Wine License
See the Wine License for further information.

This is an uninstaller for all setup programs that put an uninstall entry
into the registry, such as e.g. InstallShield or the WISE installer.
Its files have been shamelessly ripped from WineMine partially :)

TODO:
    - implement sorting of the uninstall entries
    - let the uninstall happen in a separate thread in order to be able to
      uninstall several programs concurrently

KNOWN BUGS:
    - minimizing/maximizing is broken (just as with WineMine)
    - the icon is, ermm, wrong ;-))

UNKNOWN BUGS:
    ???
