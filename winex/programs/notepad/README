NOTEPAD for WINE
================

There is now a web page dedicated to Notepad for Wine I am maintaing.
Please see http://www.vis.inf.ethz.ch/students/mbaur/notepad for 
latest info about Notepad. This page also includes screenshots.

This is an early release of notepad and most of the code is still 
broken. It will probably compile but the application will not make
much sense yet.

Please see file TODO for things to do and keep the file ChangeLog
up to date.

I also try to read wine-devel@winehq.com frequently.
